# Beyond Benchmarks: Assessing Knowledge Graph Completion Methods on Non-Benchmark Employee Data

This repository hosts the code and data for the paper titled "Beyond Benchmarks: Assessing Knowledge Graph Completion Methods on Non-Benchmark Employee Data," accepted at the International Conference on Data Science and Its Applications (ICoDSA) 2024. The research investigates the performance of Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods—TransE, ComplEx, and TransH—on a non-benchmark employee dataset within the Human Resources (HR) domain. While existing studies primarily focus on benchmark datasets, this research aims to bridge the gap by evaluating KGC methods in real-world HR scenarios. By providing insights into the adaptability and efficacy of these methods beyond traditional benchmarks, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of KGC methods' performance within industry-specific applications.

## Installation

To run the Python program associated with this repository, follow these steps:

1. Choose a directory on your local machine where you want to store the repository.

2. Clone this repository to your chosen directory using the following command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/khalidhabiburahman/kgc-non-benchmark-employee.git
    ```

3. Navigate to the cloned repository directory in your command prompt/terminal/local machine. For example, if you have cloned the repository into a folder named `my-project`, you can navigate to it using the `cd` command:

    ```bash
    cd path/to/my-project
    ```
