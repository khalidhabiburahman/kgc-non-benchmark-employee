# Beyond Benchmarks: Assessing Knowledge Graph Completion Methods on Non-Benchmark Employee Data

This repository hosts the code and data for the paper titled "Beyond Benchmarks: Assessing Knowledge Graph Completion Methods on Non-Benchmark Employee Data," accepted at the International Conference on Data Science and Its Applications (ICoDSA) 2024. The research investigates the performance of Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC) methods—TransE, ComplEx, and TransH—on a non-benchmark employee dataset within the Human Resources (HR) domain. While existing studies primarily focus on benchmark datasets, this research aims to bridge the gap by evaluating KGC methods in real-world HR scenarios. By providing insights into the adaptability and efficacy of these methods beyond traditional benchmarks, this study contributes to a deeper understanding of KGC methods' performance within industry-specific applications.
